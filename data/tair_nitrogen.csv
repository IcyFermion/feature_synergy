Gene:6532560489	AT3G30720	AT3G30720.3	protein_coding	QQS is an orphan gene that arose recently in the Arabidopsis thaliana lineage. It was first identified in a screen for genes with altered expression pattern in SS3 mutants which make an abundance of starch. Overexpression of QQS in Arabidopsis increases protein content and decreases total starch content. Thus it appears to function to modulate carbon/nitrogen allocation in Arabidopsis. Over expression of QQS in soybean, rice and maize also results in an increase in protein and decrease in starch levels suggesting that QQS affects similar pathways in a wide range of plants. QQS interacts with NF-YC4 in Arabidopsis and NF-YC4 homologs in rice, soybean and maize. In Arabidopsis QQS is localized the the cytoplasm and when complexed with NF-YC4 , it localizes to the nucleus. Putative OXS2-binding DEGs were constitutively activated by OXS2.

Gene:1005715758	AT5G50950	AT5G50950.2	protein_coding	Encodes a fumarase enzyme initially shown to be in the mitochondria through proteomic studies but later shown to be present in the cytosol using an RFP fluorescent protein tag. It appears to be important for the accumulation of fumarate from malate in leaves in the light, and helps to promote nitrogen assimilation under high nitrogen conditions. It does not appear to be necessary for lipid metabolism and seedling growth.

Mutants are resistant to ABA analogs and are resistant to high nitrogen concentrations.essential for the developmental  transition between the embryonic and vegetative  phases in plants. Overexpression results in the formation of somatic embryos on cotyledons.
